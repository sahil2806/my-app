              First Fiddle Restaurants, formerly known as The Lazeez Affaire
              Group, was conceived in the year 1999 by Priyank Sukhija and Y.P.
              Ashok. Since then, the company has made a name for itself as
              innovators and leaders in the industry. Starting with their first
              brand, Lazeez Affaire, Priyank popularised the conceptof fine dining
              at a time when the same was unheard of. Following its success, First
              Fiddle introduced the concept of casual dining with brands such as
              Warehouse Cafe, Tamasha, Lord of The Drinks, Flying Saucer Cafe, and
              more, storming Delhi’s nightlife. WIth each new brand, First Fiddle
              brought a concept that was never experienced or heard of before,
              such as Plum by Bent Chair, Miso Sexy, Diablo, and more. The
              restaurants are spread all over India in major metropolitan cities
              like New Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Lucknow and more, with plans to expand
              internationally soon.

            With over 30 restaurants in 23 years under his belt, the prolific
            restaurateur Priyank Sukhija has become somewhat of a legend in the
            industry, starting his journey at a mere age of 19. Priyank was the
            first in his family to venture into business, hailing from a family of
            lawyers, going on to create an empire in F&B. Following his heart and
            tongue through his F&B career, Priyank has successfully created some
            of the most talked-about brands in the industry - Diablo, Lord of the
            Drinks, Plum by Bent Chair, Lazeez Affaire, Tamasha, The Flying Saucer
            Cafe, and many more.
